# CCA
Based on the proposed approach, we develop a tool called CCA. CCA consists of two modules, i.e., a modeler and a generator. The modeler is realized using the open-source Petri net tool PIPE (Platform Independent Petri net Editor), which can help organizations visually model choreographies and business processes. By taking as input a choreography and a set of business processes defined in the modeler, CCA can construct a delegate for each business process.
  
Fig. 1 shows the screenshot of CCA, where the choreography and business processes of our motivating example are modeled, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the delegates for CL and SU built by CCA.
